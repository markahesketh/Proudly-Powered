Proudly Powered is blog/community looking at the very best CMS software around.

Originally being built as a WordPress related blog aimed at developers and bloggers, it quickly became apparent that each CMS is a unique tool, and Proudly Powered aims to help readers choose the right tool for the job.

While Proudly Powered is currently _just_ a humble WordPress blog, I have a lot planned over the coming months to evolve into an exciting resource for web designers, developers, bloggers, copywriters, entrepreneurs and anyone else that may need to ask 'Which is the best CMS for me?'

Proudly Powered is ran by [Mark Hesketh, a Web Designer &amp; Developer](http://www.markhesketh.co.uk "Mark Hesketh, Web Designer &amp; Developer") from Lancashire, England.
