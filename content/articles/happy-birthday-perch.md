4 years old today, [Perch](http://grabaperch.com/){:target="_blank"} is a "really little" content management system created by [edgeofmyseat](http://www.edgeofmyseat.com/){:target="_blank"}, known for being lightweight and ideal for client websites.

> Perch is a really little content management system for when you (or your clients) need to edit content without the hassle of setting up a big CMS.

To celebrate, they're sending goodie bags of Perch stuff out to anyone who purchases a ($75/Â£50 per website) license today.

Celebrate with them and '[grab a perch](https://grabaperch.com/){:target="_blank"}'. Perch also offer a demo of their CMS so you can [try before you buy](https://grabaperch.com/demo){:target="_blank"}'.
