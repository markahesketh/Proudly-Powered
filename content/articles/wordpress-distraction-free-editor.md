While writing your latest post or page it can easy to become distracted. Fortunately, WordPress gives us the distraction free editor. A way to write your posts and pages with absolutely no distractions to, as WordPress would put it, "just write".

Lapses in concentration to tinker with options, follow advice from your WordPress plugins, or simply deciding how to categorise your post can really slow down your writing.

If '[content is king](http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/10/infographic-why-content-is-kin.php){:target="_blank"}'
then it's very important to give it your full attention.

The WordPress Post UI is very nice of course, and WordPress' UI is a major selling point to using WordPress as your CMS platform, but sometimes being left with just your writing is nice. Back to basics.

The difference here is night and day. There is absolutely nothing to
distract your writing. All of the WordPress slowly fades and all that
remains is your content.

Using the WordPress Distraction Free Editor
-------------------------------------------

Activating the distraction free editor is as simple as pressing a button
in your post editor toolbox.

Simply press the button shown above and enjoy no distractions while
writing content.

Using Distraction Free Editor Shortcuts
=======================================

If you'd like to add some lists, emphasise content with bolds and
italics, or simply add a link, you can show the distraction free editor
toolbox by hovering towards the top of your browser's window.

I would recommend getting to grips with the keyboard shortcuts for editing your content.

Using the shortcuts will really speed up your writing, while using the distraction free editor allows you to easily put your thoughts into words.

It's a great combination. After using the shortcuts for a single post they will start to become second nature. Adding more links to your posts will enhance your content, while also feeling less of a chore, and most importantly not distracting you from your writing.

Use the distraction free editor
-------------------------------

Give it a go! If you find sometimes that you can't write your content as quickly or easily as you may like, then WordPress' distraction free editor is definitely worth a look.

If you'd like to take it one step further, the WordPress team also recommend using [white noise](http://www.simplynoise.com/){:target="_blank"} to really focus your concentration.
