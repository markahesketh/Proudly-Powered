Since putting [Proudly Powered online just
yesterday](http://proudlypowered.com/hello-world/), I have had to go
through the usual steps of installing recommended WordPress plugins to
enhance the website.

As of course this is a WordPress powered website
being built-in 2012, I thought I'd take this opportunity to create a
quick run down of recommended WordPress plugins to be used.

This list is by no means complete, you may have your preferences, but they come
highly recommended as I use them on [my other WordPress driven
websites](http://www.prestadb.com) as well as here on Proudly Powered.

Akismet
-------

[Akismet](http://akismet.com/?return=true) is a very smart comment and trackback spam filtering WordPress plugin developed by the folks at [Automattic](http://automattic.com/).

![WordPress PluginAkismet](/media/wordpress-plugin-akismet.jpg)

It is very likely you will recognise the name, or even be actively using
this plugin as it comes pre-installed (but not activated) with your
WordPress installation.

Akismet intelligently recognises spam based on
knowledge gathered from millions of websites. This means that you don't
have to bother your *real*Â visitors with CAPTCHA boxes and such.

Detected spam is flagged in your WordPress Admin, and can be removed or approved as you see fit.

W3 Total Cache
--------------

A *must install* WordPress plugin in my humble opinion.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/rkmrQP8S5KY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Developed by [Frederick Townes](http://www.linkedin.com/in/w3edge), [W3 Total
Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/) is built to
speed up your WordPress website.

W3 Total Cache includes Page / Database / Object Caching, Minifying, CDN Support, CloudFlare integration and
much more.

If all of that doesn't mean anything to you, rest assured
that just using the default settings will dramatically improve the speed
of your website. Install and see the benefits.

Page speed is important for your visitor's user experience, but if that's not enough for you
[it's widely known that Google likes a fast websites](http://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/), and will
repay you with better rankings.

WordPress SEO
-------------

[WordPress SEO](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/) does 'exactly what it says on the tin'.

<img class="align-right" src="/media/wordpress-plugin-wordpress-seo.jpg" alt="WordPress Plugin WordPress SEO" />

The WordPress SEO plugin will handle nearly all aspects of your
WordPress website's SEO, from your XML sitemaps to analysing your
content and offering suggestions regarding your targeted keywords.

Developed by SEO and WordPress expert Joost de Valk aka
[Yoast](http://yoast.com/), Joost has included much of his experience in
his plugin. As Akismet and W3 Total Cache, in my opinion WordPress SEO
is invaluable to your WordPress website and should be one of the first
WordPress plugins installed.

Adminimize
----------

The [Adminimize](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adminimize/)
WordPress plugin lets you hide 'unnecessary' items from the WordPress
admin area for certain users.

> "Adminimize is a WordPress plugin that lets you hide 'unnecessary'
> items from the WordPress backend and many more ..."

If you're like me and worry a user or client may have too much access to
certain areas of the websites administration, such as 'Editors' being
able to change themes then this plugin is for you.

You can also customise the WordPress admin dashboard, removing certain blocks to
specific users, and even easily adding your own which could be
particularly instructions when giving instructions to your authors or
clients.

Other WordPress plugins such as [White Label CMS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/white-label-cms/) have similar
functionality, and you could also do this through your `functions.php` if you preferred, but
[Adminimize](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adminimize/) can be
considered as an 'all-in-one' WordPress plugin, allowing you to hide
pretty much everything in the WordPress admin from a single interface.

[Download WordPress Plugin: Adminimize](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adminimize/)

After the Deadline
------------------

As a [Web Designer & Developer](http://www.markhesketh.co.uk), writing
doesn't come as naturally to me as it would say a real copywriter.

> After the Deadline uses artificial intelligence to check spelling, style, and grammar in WordPress.

Luckily, the [After the
Deadline](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/after-the-deadline/)
WordPress plugin is here to help. The plugin will 'read' your posts
before submitting them for publish, offering suggestions and
improvements.

It's a great way of proofreading your work and I've found
it to be very useful. The suggestions are often quite insightful, and 9
times out of 10 allows me to craft a better sentence.

Additionally, [After the Deadline](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/after-the-deadline/)
teaches me to write better. By taking on the WordPress plugin's
suggestions I find that it finds less and less wrong with my posts as my
writing style improves over time through its criticism.

[Download WordPress Plugin: After the Deadline](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/after-the-deadline/)

FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend
---------------------------

<img class="align-right" src="/media/wordpress-plugins-feedburner-flame-150x150.png" alt="WordPress Plugins Feedburner Flame" />

[FeedBurner](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/myfeeds?gsessionid=UkSHlgQVjWzCK1lNYMC_Sg)
is a service provided by Google, it basically provides an external URL
to host your feed as well as providing other useful gadgets such as
subscriber tracking.

[FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-setting/) is a
simple plugin that will change all WordPress' references to your RSS
feed to an external FeedBurner feed that you've set up.

[Download WordPress Plugin: FeedBurner FeedSmith Extend](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-setting/)

Google Analytics for WordPress
------------------------------

A self-explantory title, but [Google Analytics for
WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/)
is a simple plugin created by WordPress SEO author Yoast to add the
asynchronous Google Analytics snippet to your website.

![WordPress Plugin Google Analytics for WordPress](/media/wordpress-plugin-google-analytics-for-wordpress.jpg)

The plugin is very simple, and will even connect straight to your
Analytics account where you can select your website's profile rather
than remembering your `UA-XXXXXX-X` ID numbers.

This WordPress plugin is particularly useful as it means you needn't worry
about remembering to include the snippet in your WordPress theme's
`footer.php`, and so will remain active if you switch themes.

[Download WordPress Plugin: Google Analytics for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/)

Secure WordPress
----------------

Created by [WordPress Defender](http://www.websitedefender.com/), [Secure WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/secure-wordpress/) allows you an easy way to secure your WordPress website.

> Secure WordPress beefs up the security of your WordPress installation
> by removing error information on login pages, adds index.html to
> plugin directories, hides the WordPress version and much more.

Everything is possible through a simple interface in the WordPress
Plugin settings, just install the plugin, check your options and you're
done.

SSH SFTP Updater Support
------------------------

By default, WordPress provides functionality to upload and update your
WordPress plugins and core WordPress files via FTP and FTPS in the
admin.

If however you don't connect to your web server via FTP and
instead use SFTP a nice option is to use [SSH SFTP Updater
Support](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ssh-sftp-updater-support/).

> "SSH SFTP Updater Support" is the easiest way to keep your WordPress installation up-to-date with SFTP.

As the quote suggests, this is a simple solution. You'll be a given a third option of *SFTP* when updating your WordPress plugins etc.

Just provide your login information and updates and installs will be carried
out in exactly the same way as they would via the FTP options.

[Download WordPress Plugin: SSH SFTP Updater Support](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ssh-sftp-updater-support/)

White Label CMS
---------------

[White Label CMS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/white-label-cms/)
allows you to customise little sections of your authors / clients
WordPress admin experience.

![WordPress Plugin White Label CMS](/media/wordpress-plugin-white-label-cms.jpg)

You can edit the WordPress login screen and WordPress admin logos, as
well as remove various areas of WordPress admin menu.

If you wish, you can also customise snippets of text in the admin area, such as the
footer area where you could place a little link back to your agency for
example.

[White Label CMS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/white-label-cms/) is a simple
plugin that allows you to quickly tailor the WordPress Admin to your
client's / agency's brand.

[Download WordPress Plugin: White Label CMS](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/white-label-cms/)

WordPress Editorial Calendar
----------------------------

If you run a WordPress website with multiple authors, or like to keep a
tight schedule on your posts, then the [Editorial
Calendar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/editorial-calendar/)
WordPress plugin gives you a calendar visual to plan all your posts

![WordPress Plugin Editorial Calendar](/media/wordpress-plugin-editorial-calendar.png)

The calendar interface lets you clearly see when posts are scheduled to
be posted and plan accordingly and you can easily reschedule posts by
dragging them between dates on the calendar.

I personally use the calendar to not only plan the scheduling of posts, but to also keep a
track of drafts that are to be written.

This is helpful as it means your drafted posts, and the post scheduled is seen by all your authors too.

[Download WordPress Plugin: WordPress Editorial Calendar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/editorial-calendar/)

WP Smush.it
-----------

> Smush.it uses optimization techniques specific to image format to
> remove unnecessary bytes from image files. It is a "lossless" tool,
> which means it optimizes the images without changing their look or
> visual quality. After Smush.it runs on a web page it reports how many
> bytes would be saved by optimizing the page's images and provides a
> downloadable zip file with the minimized image files.

The [WP Smush.it](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-smushit/)
WordPress plugin is an easy way to use Yahoo!'s useful [Smush.it
service](http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/) on the fly.

Your images will be optimised on upload, but you can also 'smush' any of your previously
uploaded images from older posts too.

[Smush.it](http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/) is highly recommended to
keep your image file sizes down, and your web pages fast, and the [WP
Smush.it](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-smushit/) WordPress
plugin offers a really easy way to achieve this on your site.

[Download WordPress plugin: WP Smush.it](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-smushit/)
